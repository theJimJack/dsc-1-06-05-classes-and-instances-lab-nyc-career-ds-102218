Jeff's review:

  1. create an object with setters and getters, use properties set and retrieve properties.

  class Driver():

      def get_driver_first(self):
          return self._first

      def set_driver_first(self, first):
          self._first = first

      def del_driver_first(self):
          del self._first

      first = property(get_driver_first, set_driver_first, del_driver_first)

  2. Explain self
      Starts as a ghost
      Draws consistency between all of a class's functions
  3. explain __init__
      Set parameters
      parameters that are necessary for the class

  4. What are the benefits of objects?
      provides a blueprint that can be modified as needed, but the initial structure remains
